## Technical Architecture

### Network Topology

The Elmahrosa Blockchain employs a multi-layered network architecture designed for scalability, security, and performance. The network consists of three primary layers working in harmony to deliver a robust blockchain platform:

1. **Consensus Layer**: Manages block validation and consensus (PoS + PoA hybrid).
2. **Smart Contract Layer**: Handles execution and verification of smart contracts.
3. **Application Layer**: Supports DApps, APIs, and user interfaces.

## Example: Hybrid Consensus Mechanism (PoS + PoA)

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

/// @title Example Hybrid Validator Contract (PoS + PoA)
contract HybridValidator {
    mapping(address => bool) public validators;
    mapping(address => uint256) public stakes;

    event ValidatorAdded(address validator);
    event StakeDeposited(address staker, uint256 amount);

    // Only existing validators can add new validators (PoA)
    function addValidator(address _validator) external {
        require(validators[msg.sender], "Not a validator");
        validators[_validator] = true;
        emit ValidatorAdded(_validator);
    }

    // Any user can stake tokens to participate (PoS)
    function stake() external payable {
        require(msg.value > 0, "Stake must be greater than 0");
        stakes[msg.sender] += msg.value;
        emit StakeDeposited(msg.sender, msg.value);
    }
}
